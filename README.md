# UFO Sightings: Fact of Fancy?

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to begin the journey of learning JavaScript by looking into its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and vizualization. In this project I will assist Dana, a data journalist, as she writes an article about her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon. According to Dana her hometown is famous for its UFO sightings that go back to her choldhood during the 1950's. She has decided to use a Javascript data file she received to create a Webpage for her story and to make the data available to others. We will build a dynamic Webpage by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page. It will also be important to draw upon my knowledge of CSS and Boootstrap to build and style the page for consistent functionality. I'll also use ChromeDev tools to test the code created for the Webpage.

Specifically, I am going to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria. The page will display Dana's article and give those who visit her page the opportunity to interact with the data and search for UFO sightings based on defined criteria. This will be a wonderful opportunity to assist Dana in creating a useable tool for those who are interested in searching for UFO sightings that occurred throughout the United States.
